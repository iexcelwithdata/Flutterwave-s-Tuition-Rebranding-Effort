# Tuition Rebranding Project Analysis

This repository contains the analysis conducted for the Tuition platform project by Altwave Team A, as part of a collaborative effort sponsored by Flutterwave.

## Project Overview

The Tuition rebranding project aimed to assess the suitability of the current brand name, "Tuition," in representing a broader scope beyond just payment solutions. Given the platform’s expanded objectives as a source of educational information, this analysis sought to understand user perceptions and propose a brand name that aligns with these new goals.

### Objectives

1. **Perception Analysis:** Gauge how potential users interpret the brand "Tuition."
2. **Engagement Assessment:** Evaluate the likelihood of engagement based on the current brand identity.
3. **Brand Alignment Evaluation:** Determine if the name "Tuition" aligns with the platform's mission and objectives.
4. **User Expectations:** Identify qualities that users expect in a brand name.

### Key Findings

- Most respondents associated "Tuition" with payment-related solutions.
- Engagement ratings were below the desired threshold, suggesting potential for improvement.
- Users preferred brand names that are clear, informative, memorable, and aligned with educational themes.

### Proposed Brand Names

Respondents suggested alternatives such as:
- Edupay
- Studypay
- Scholarshub
- Edumation
- Educon
- CollegHub

These names resonate with the educational focus and objectives of the platform.

### Recommendations

Based on the survey results and analysis, we recommend:
1. Refining the brand name to better represent the platform’s educational focus.
2. Implementing strategies to increase user engagement.
3. Ensuring the brand identity is clear, memorable, and distinctive.
