# Tuition Rebranding Project Analysis

This repository contains the analysis conducted for the Tuition platform rebranding project by Altwave Team A, as part of a collaborative effort sponsored by Flutterwave.

## About

This project aimed to assess the suitability of the **Tuition** brand name in representing a broader educational scope beyond just payment solutions. Conducted by **Altwave Team A** with the support of **Flutterwave**, the analysis focused on understanding user perceptions, engagement potential, and expectations to help guide strategic brand development and alignment with educational objectives.

Our team gathered insights from potential users to evaluate how well the name "Tuition" resonates with the platform's expanded mission as a comprehensive educational tool, not just a payment solution.

## Project Overview

The analysis process involved several stages, from data collection to presenting insights. Below is a breakdown of each step:

### 1. Data Collection
We started by designing a comprehensive survey form to capture essential data points on user perceptions, engagement likelihood, and expectations of a brand name. The survey was distributed to a target audience aligned with the platformâ€™s potential user base, ensuring relevant feedback.

### 2. Survey Creation
The survey form was meticulously crafted to cover key areas:
   - **Perception Analysis**: Gauging how users interpret the brand name "Tuition" and its association with educational services.
   - **Engagement Assessment**: Evaluating respondents' likelihood of engaging with the platform based on the brand's identity.
   - **Brand Alignment Evaluation**: Checking if the name "Tuition" aligns with the broader mission of providing educational support beyond payments.
   - **User Expectations**: Identifying qualities users seek in a brand name to inform possible rebranding options.

### 3. Data Analysis with Looker Studio
After collecting survey responses, we used **Looker Studio** for data analysis and visualization:
   - **Data Processing**: We cleaned and organized the collected data to prepare it for insightful analysis.
   - **Visualization**: Using Looker Studio, we created visuals to represent trends in user perceptions, engagement levels, and brand expectations, helping to draw actionable insights.
   - **Insight Extraction**: We analyzed patterns and correlations to determine key findings, which informed our recommendations for rebranding.

## Objectives

- **Perception Analysis**: Gauge how potential users interpret the brand "Tuition."
- **Engagement Assessment**: Evaluate the likelihood of engagement based on the current brand identity.
- **Brand Alignment Evaluation**: Determine if the name "Tuition" aligns with the platform's mission and objectives.
- **User Expectations**: Identify qualities that users expect in a brand name.

## Key Findings

- Most respondents associated "Tuition" with payment-related solutions.
- Engagement ratings were below the desired threshold, suggesting potential for improvement.
- Users preferred brand names that are clear, informative, memorable, and aligned with educational themes.

### Proposed Brand Names
Based on feedback, respondents suggested alternatives such as:

- **Edupay**
- **Studypay**
- **Scholarshub**
- **Edumation**
- **Educon**
- **CollegeHub**

These names resonate with the educational focus and objectives of the platform, potentially enhancing user engagement and brand clarity.

## Recommendations

Based on the survey results and analysis, we recommend:
1. **Brand Realignment**: Consider rebranding the platform with a name that emphasizes its broader educational support role.
2. **User Engagement Strategy**: Develop initiatives that clarify the platform's educational value beyond payments to improve user engagement.
3. **Continuous Feedback Collection**: Regularly gather user feedback to ensure that the platform remains aligned with user expectations and market trends.

## Conclusion

This rebranding project provided hands-on experience in survey design, data analysis, and strategic branding within the fintech and edtech sectors. With Flutterwave's support, we gained insights into how a brand's identity impacts user perception and engagement, informing our strategic recommendations for the Tuition platform's growth.
