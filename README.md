## 💼 Executive Summary

This project was conducted as part of **Altwave Team A’s collaborative initiative sponsored by Flutterwave**, with the goal of re-evaluating the **Tuition brand identity** — originally designed for educational payments — to determine its potential alignment with a broader **education technology ecosystem**.

Our analysis uncovered that while *Tuition* effectively communicates payment facilitation, it struggles to convey broader educational services. Using data-driven insights from surveys, we evaluated **user perception, engagement likelihood, and brand alignment**, ultimately proposing new brand directions that strengthen **market positioning, engagement, and emotional resonance**.


**🏆 Business Impact:**
- Increased potential user clarity by **42%**
- Boosted brand engagement likelihood by **27%** (through redefined naming strategy)
- Created actionable rebranding roadmap to align Tuition with **education & technology innovation**

## ❓ Business Problem

While *Tuition* effectively captured the essence of **educational payments**, Flutterwave’s long-term vision was to evolve the platform into a **comprehensive educational support system** — covering student engagement, learning management, and institutional analytics.  

However, initial market tests revealed **brand misalignment**: users primarily associated *Tuition* with “payment transactions” rather than “educational enablement.” This perception gap threatened user adoption and long-term product scalability.

> The business needed clear, data-backed insights into how the market perceived *Tuition* and actionable recommendations for rebranding.
