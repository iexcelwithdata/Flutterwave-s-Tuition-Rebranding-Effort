**Product Analytics | Market Intelligence | Decision Support (EdTech × FinTech)**

---

## 🔑 Executive Outcome

Conducted a **data-driven product perception analysis** to evaluate whether *Tuition by Flutterwave* could scale beyond payments into a broader education technology platform.

**Impact:**
- Identified a **clear perception constraint**: 68% of users associated *Tuition* with payments only
- Quantified a **27% uplift in engagement likelihood** under alternative brand positioning
- Delivered evidence-backed recommendations that supported a **strategic rebranding decision**

**Primary Use Cases:**  
Product positioning, go-to-market strategy, brand scalability assessment

---

## 🧠 Decision Problem

Flutterwave’s long-term vision was to expand *Tuition* from an education payments tool into a **broader education enablement platform**.

However, early market signals suggested:
- The brand name anchored user perception to **transactional payments**
- Broader platform capabilities were **not intuitively inferred** by users
- Misaligned perception risked **slowing adoption and limiting product extensibility**

The business needed **objective evidence** to determine whether the brand could scale — or required repositioning.

- Synthesized insights into **clear, executive-ready recommendations**
